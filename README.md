- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kryptique
- 👀 I’m interested in PC gaming and Scifi/horror Movies/Tv show and cooking mostly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code WoW classic Era addons by using Co-pilot which speeds up the learning process.
- 💞️ Just using git to store my code and leaving it here for people to use it as they please. I'm not looking to colaborate or improve with features people want, I do this mostly for myself.  If you want to use my code, go ahead, I won't stop you and you dont need to give me credits for any of it.
